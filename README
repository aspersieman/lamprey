LAMPrey for Ubuntu/Debian
---------------------------

This program is a tray icon that allows you to start/stop Apache and MySQL with
a single mouse click. It's specifically tailored upon Ubuntu/Debian, most likely
it won't work elsewhere without modifications of the commands to start, stop
and check the status of the services.

It works for the Apache and MySQL packages bundled with Ubuntu/Debian itself.

To use it effectively you should add /usr/bin/lamprey to your desktop's
autostart programs.
